Hi there,

I am Nick, a PhD student in computational bayesian medical genomics. 
At the moment I am working on high performance large scale model implementations for the prediction of medical phenotypes from genomic data.

I like Rust and would like to help offer our community the tools it needs to transition from C++ to Rust as the main language for high performance model implementations.
